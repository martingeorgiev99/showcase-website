                    Programming experience
                </h2>

                <p class="text">
                    My first programming experience was attempting to be a self-taught developer using Python.<br>
                    I learned advanced Python and became somewhat sufficient in it, after that I went on to try messing
                    around with Java -
                    that ended up getting me an internship in a banking software company - as a back-end junior
                    developer.
                    It lasted a couple months but when it came to an end I just stopped developing stuff overall.<br>

                    The next time I went on to program was when I had reached the finals of high school and I had the
                    chance
                    to hop on a self-chosen project - I chose to create a hardware monitor for a computer using
                    Python - <a href="https://github.com/loseisok/diploma_project_simple">Github repository</a>
                    of said project. It consists of an open-source hardware monitoring application and a python script
                    looped for a set amount of time, checking the state of the specs of a given computer every e.g 5
                    seconds.

                    <br><br>Once this project was done I once again stopped coding until now.
